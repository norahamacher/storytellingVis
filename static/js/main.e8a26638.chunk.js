Historically, both have been used for a long time and evolved from just vocal to modern times. The image of one person in the midst of an audience, telling a story and underlining it with drawings in the sand should be familiar to most people. ","Humans remember things easier when they are accompanied by images. A good storyteller is valued for being able to construct images in people's minds, but it can be ever more powerful if real, meaningful images can be provided.","In these modern, digital, online times powerful visualisations in 2D, 3D, VR, AR, on the web or in print are available and used on a daily basis.
